description: Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is to
  discuss energy balance in terms of the flux from the host star and the energy absorbed
  by a planet, while considering atmospheric circulation. Students will derive the
  formula for energy balance and learn how scientists calculate planetary equilibrium
  temperatures.
