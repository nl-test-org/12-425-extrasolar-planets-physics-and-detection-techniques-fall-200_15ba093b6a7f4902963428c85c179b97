description: Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is to
  discuss the origin of absorption and emission lines in the exoplanetary spectra
  and what they represent mathematically. Students will become familiar with Kirchhoff?s
  Law, a second solution of the radiative transfer equation, and the mathematical
  approach to understanding thermal emission spectra.
