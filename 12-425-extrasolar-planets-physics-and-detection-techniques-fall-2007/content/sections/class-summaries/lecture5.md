description: Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this class was to
  continue the previous lecture discussion on radial velocities. The lecture introduced
  students to radial velocity curves, specifically how to read and understand their
  key features and use those to derive planet mass. Lecture began with a review of
  the derivation of planet mass using the equation for an elliptical orbit in the
  plane of the motion of orbit, finding planet motion in the direct line of sight,
  and then using Kepler?s second law of motion to calculate the planet mass.
